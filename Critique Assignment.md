## INTRODUCTION

For my critique, I chose Left Behind: Girls Education in Africa. An interactive data tool from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) that shows the challenges ahead in global education through data. It is a narrative of about roughly 28 millions girls between the ages of 6 and 15 who are out of school across the region. It lets you explore a wide range of data for the region and beyond. How many years of school can girls expect to receive? To what extent are girls enrolling in primary and lower secondary school compared to boys? And what about the classroom conditions that are shaping the learning experiences of girls across the continent? How many schools have access to electricity, drinking water and separate toilets for girls and boys? It focuses on finding out what needs to change by exploring data. 

The topic is detailed in the meta tags in the header of the code when you view source or inspect element, as here:

## ANALYSIS
From observation, I can see that the author is trying create a narrative. There is a vertical dotted line on the extreme left, that helps the reader navigate through the different graphs and pages, each starting with a title slide and then subsequent insights backed by interactive graphs.The reader can scroll, creating an individual experience according to his or her own pace.

From inspecting element on the site, I can see that it uses HTML.

In the Console, I noticed there was an error Uncaught TypeError: uis.unesco.org/:1849 Uncaught TypeError: $.trackLinks is not a function at uis.unesco.org/:1849

I really like the interactivity of the maps and how colors change and elements are highlighted when you hover over and also how the text appears. Even the sheer number of the diffeernt kinds of graphs used to visualize each point is very interesting. At points, however I wondered whether this was the best way to show this data?
